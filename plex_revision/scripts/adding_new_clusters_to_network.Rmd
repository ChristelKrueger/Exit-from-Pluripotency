After producing the new cluster groups for EM and Louvain clustering, I also need to add this information to the network graph.
I have exported the current annotation of the edges and will add the cluster groups via the interaction identifier.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Importing data

```{r}
read_csv("../data/edges_original_241206.csv") -> edges_original
read_tsv("../data/interaction_pairs_uncapped.txt") -> interaction_pairs_uncapped
```

Tidying and merging

```{r}
edges_original %>% 
  select(-e_cluster_id) -> edges

interaction_pairs_uncapped %>% 
  select(interaction_ID, EM_cluster_group, Louvain_cluster_group) %>% 
  rename(e_interaction_id = interaction_ID) -> assignments

edges %>% 
  left_join(assignments) %>% 
  relocate(EM_cluster_group, Louvain_cluster_group,.after = e_interaction_id) -> edges_new

head(edges_new)
```

Writing out

```{r}
write_csv(edges_new, "../output/tables/edges_241210.csv")
```
